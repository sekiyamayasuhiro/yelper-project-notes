Divided into 4 main sections

# Cycling Image section

    - 4 images with some kind of caption on top of it
    - (Optional) Include button that when clicked it will do a search with the filter for the picture category. (If the picture is of ramen, the button that goes with the picture will do a search for ramen.)
    - (Optional) Try to make the picture take the whole section including the above (so the nav bar is on top of the picture).
